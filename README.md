PeerFlix-GUI


An experiment in node-webkit, and torrent-stream;

Inspired by peerflix; I wrote this in as primarily an learning exersise in node and torrent-stream

TODO:

Priority: Figure out how to build.

1. Visual Overhaul
2. Support Torrent Files
3. Remove Node Server Streaming. (or leave it...for streaming to other applications?)
4. Support Direct to Program Streaming
